#TODO

---------------------------------------
## In Progress
---------------------------------------
[] There's a "new pathway" button on the pathway index page for _everyone_
[] Verify that "objective" is not a step field and remove it from step edit form
[] Reports section on activity single view tries to use name but is borked
[] Category view pathway counts are wrong as they include draft pathways that 
    are there but not shown
[] You file a report on an activity you are redirected to the activities index 
    and not the profile page like they should be
[] When pathway completed update database with date!
[] Implement step sorting
[] Develop reports dashboard
[] Edit user template needs love
[] there's a grey bar under the colorful div when no content; fix that

---------------------------------------
## PLANNED 
---------------------------------------

[] Generate QR codes for pathways
[] Put a link to the Learning Hub in the footer
[] Fix reports on activity page
[] Include reports on curator view of user profile 
[] Can I create a "Learning Centre" Github organization?
[] Can we host stuff on GitHub Pages? https://bcgov.github.io/learningcurator ??
[] Docker licensing?
[] Add more ministries to mapping in (and consider how to fix this)
    /vendor/cakedc/users/src/Model/Behavior/SocialBehavior.php
[] List of Curators and what paths/activities they've authored
[] Implement estimated time view
[] Topic manager role? Contributor role
[] User role beside name in index
[] Check that URLs for activities don't already exist
[] submit pathway follow/unfollow via JS to prevent page reload
[] TAGGING
[] RSS feeds for new pathways and per-path new activity feeds
[] RSS feed for new reports
[] send email on report submission
[] Tags for pathways
[] Add publish option at pathway level that publishes all steps and activities
[] Add "hold" status for activities that aren't draft, but shouldn't be
    published (this way you can run above publish all, but still leave things out)
[] Export to browser bookmarks organized by folder Area/Topic/Pathway/Step/https://Activity
[] Import of browser bookmarks organized by folder
[] Add contributor role and then a publishing workflow where contributors must have the work approved by a curator
   [] ceate heirarchy document showing Curator
