 * Keep it simple!! Reply on Bootstrap as **much as possible**, 
 * while adding in some flavor. Seriously: if you're in here
 * adding stuff, please be as minimalist as possible, and try
 * not to alter things like margins and padding (use utility
 * classes instead). For the most part, the intention here
 * is to override colors and only adding absolutely necessary
 * custom elements.
