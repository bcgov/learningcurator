# Learning Curator

Learning Curator Pathways feature informal learning by theme or community. Here youâ€™ll find recommendations for resources to watch, read, listen to, and courses that will help you reach your goals. Pathways are created by BC Public Service learning curators. 

An emerging project from the Learning Centre for the BC Public Service Agency.

## Features

There are topics which have pathways. Pathways have steps; steps have activities; activies are categorized and tagged. A signed in user can follow pathways and claim activites, tracking their own progress via activity rings.

Area > Topic > Pathway > Step > Activity 

## Usage
Follow pathways and complete the activities; informal, self-directed learning but guided by a curated structure that makes sense and is timely.
