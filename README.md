# Learning Curator

Content from many different sources curated into loosely structured learning pathways. These pathways have objectives which are divided up into steps. Each step has various activities (which are simply links out to a resource), some of which are required, while others are supplemental. A step might include two in-person courses, an eLearning course, two books, three videos, and a podcast. Users can track which activities they've consumed, and as they do so, their progress is displayed as colorful progress rings.

An emerging project from the Learning Centre for the BC Public Service Agency.

## Features

There are categories of pathways. Pathways have steps; steps have activities; activies are categorized and tagged. A signed in user can follow pathways and claim activites, tracking their own progress via activity rings.

## Usage
Follow pathways and complete the activities; informal, self-directed learning but guided by a structure that makes sense and is timely and curated.
