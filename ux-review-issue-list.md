# To do for UI/UX 
- Description of elements and how it works together - not just pathways - & how it will provide value 
- Profile nav 
- An image for branding/communicating what the site is about. 
- Featured pathways purpose/value unknown b/c new users don't know what pathways are yet. 
- move privacy to a page on another part of the site & reduce footer 
- Actually name it "home" page. 
- Add personalized dashboard feel with categories list - see wireframe 
- Dual "pathways" navigation menu on profile - change so it's Your Pathways 
- Remove featured pathways section from profile page. Include a call to action button or describe the pathways better. 
- Change icons to words for activity type 
- Consider improvements to "claim" perhaps use "complete" language instead. "Completed" vs. "in progress" 
- Contributions for Curators only 
- Reports titling may be misleading. Issues. And change delete button to "close issue." 
- Follow pathway right rom screen. 
- Breadcrumbs isn't displaying the pathway so it's part of keeping the hierarchy invisible. We should add current page to the breadcrumb. 
- Pathway goal doesn't tell user how they interact with the page. 
- Colours add another layer of confusion. Now that the legend is gone... 
- Timestamp for pathway... is it there for a reason? (For users? Would be good for curator to know.) 
- Time estimates. "several days" is too vague. Use hours. 
- Move follow pathway to the header section 
- Step order was confusing - the user doesn't have to follow the steps in a particular order. So if they don't need to be done in order, there's no reason to number them. 
- narrow column of content on page - is that for responsiveness? Allan indicates it's for readability 
- choose one pathway progress indicator - step/pathway confusing 
- colours on type is adding a layer of complexity 
- time estimation - consistent in hours only 
- differentiating the supplementary section from required - use "required" as a heading. They're interpreting hte required after seeing "supplemental." 
- In title "Recently Added Activities"
