    "description": "Building a trust-based relationship requires a fundamental understanding that \"relationship\" is the foundation from which all activities happen and that building a good relationship takes time and commitment. It is a willingness to build a personal relationship in addition to a professional one, participating in open exchanges of experiences and culture. It requires a genuine, non-controlling approach and relies upon demonstrated integrity and transparency, through a lens of cultural safety. Building a trust-based relationship requires a high level of consciousness of the experience of Indigenous people with Crown relations. It assumes that strengths abound in Indigenous people, cultures and communities.",
    "objective": "To have a solid understanding of what cultural safety is, and how building trusting relationships with Indigenous peoples requires competency in all aspects of cultural safety and agility. ",
